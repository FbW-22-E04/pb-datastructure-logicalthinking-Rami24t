// loop the all arrays indexes, 2 items at a time, compare them and and move the biggest item to the highest index and the lowest in the lowest;
// loop again but now with one less index (decrease looping/sorting scope by one)
// keep doing until looping scope is less than 2 items.
// now the array is sorted.
